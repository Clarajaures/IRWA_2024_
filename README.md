Part-4

To execute this part of the code, you need to follow the following steps: First, download the folder on the GitHub repo called "part-4" containing all the lab 4 files.

When you open the folder, you will find 2 files: o The first one is a zip-folder folder called "search-engine-web-app." Open this folder and navigate the corresponding path. Once inside this folder, open the terminal with this path and execute the following line of code: python web_app.py. When you execute this in your terminal, you may need to install some libraries. If everything is correct, your terminal will display an IP like this: http://127.0.0.1:8088. Click on this link, and our work will appear. If you have a Mac, it might open the path like this: http://0.0.0.0:8088. In that case, you will need to manually change the link to resemble the first one when you click on it. Once all of this is done, you can try and explore any tweet you want.

o The second file is named "IRWA-2024-u199904-u198730-u198738-part-4." This is the PDF with all the explanations, our results of the lab, and the procedure that we followed to complete everything.

You will need to add farmers-protest-tweets.json because due to its size we cannot commit the lab and we were told we cannot publish a zip
